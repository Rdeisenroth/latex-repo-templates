# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
jobs:
  build:
    # The type of runner that the job will run on
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    # automatically cancel the workflow if it runs longer than 10 minutes

    # The docker image to use for the container
    container:

    # Steps represent a sequence of tasks that will be executed as part of the job
    steps:
      # 1. Checks-out your repository under $GITHUB_WORKSPACE, so your job can access it
      - name: Set up Git repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      # 2. Build the document
      - name: "Build the document"
        run: |
          make -j
          mv build/*.pdf .

      # 3. Upload artifacts to GitHub

  # The following step deploys the PDF to Nextcloud via WebDAV. The new NextHessenbox should work perfectly fine with this. The idea is to generate one link, where others can always find the latest version of your document (e.g. your reviewers for your thesis)
